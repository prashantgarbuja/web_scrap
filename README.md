# Web Scraping Google Trends

This project involves web scraping Google Trends data in Australia (or Anywhere in the World) using Python. The data is scraped using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, and the results are saved in a CSV file. The entire process is automated using GitHub Actions, and the resulting CSV file is stored as an artifact.
